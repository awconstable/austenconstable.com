8am wake up and a simple breakfast of cereals.
 
Einy has not been well waking me up in the middle of the night with a present on the floor. Probably eating the dead sheep yesterday!

We packed and serviced the van for the first time, taking a while to figure out where the key for the grey water tap was. Turns out, the glove box.

We set off for Scotland, a pretty long but uneventful drive. We had tried to find a flogas refill but to no avail.
Arriving at the campsite just before 5pm we parked up, went to explore, and a drink in the campsite bar.

After a drink outside in the glorious evening we decide to stay and eat rather than the schedule homemade casserole. 
Alex and I had haggis, neeps and tatties which was delicious.

Back to the camper for a game of Ticket to Ride before an episode of Task Master and an early night ahead of Ben Nevis tomorrow.
