Last night was much better, without the storm we all slept a little easier.

Our usual early start and baconators whilst we checked the weather and discussed the plan. 
With the weather being calmer today, I'm keen to finish the job and climb, but that would mean driving back to London after a day in the mountains.
 
We eventually decide that climbing Snowdon would be a mistake and decide to drive home, resolving to come back another weekend to finish the job.

After an uneventful drive back home we unpack and clean the motor home ready to return it tomorrow. 
I'm a little apprehensive leaving it parked on the street outside, but we have no choice.

We're all glad to be home, knowing we made the right choice about not climbing Snowdown today and vote for an early night in our own beds.
