Since I was a child and in the Scouts I've wanted to complete the [3 Peaks Challenge](https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/national-three-peaks-challenge/).
Whilst completing all 3 in 24 hours is too much for a family holiday, spreading it over a week is more than doable.
We love to hike and were looking for a summer holiday what would include Einstein, the family Dashhund. The 3 Peaks sounded perfect! 

## Our Itinerary

* Day 1 - Collect the motorhome and drive to Brascote
* Day 2 - Drive to the Lake District
* Day 3 - Rest day
* Day 4 - Drive to Scotland
* Day 5 - Hike Ben Nevis (1345m)
* Day 6 - Drive back to England
* Day 7 - Hike Scafell Pike (978m)
* Day 8 - Drive to Wales
* Day 9 - Hike Snowdon (1085m)
* Day 10 - Drive to London

The trickiest aspect will be the tight schedule and the weather - we will have to climb rain or shine, or skip a mountain under extreme conditions!
