It's been a rough night, gale force winds have been battering the motor home, and it was boiling hot due to the closed windows.
I'm awake at 6 and the camp site has taken some pummeling. I check the mountain forecast, and it's not looking good. 
Storm Betty passed through last night, which explains the wind overnight. However the forecast on Snowdon today expects 70 mile an hour gale force winds with no visibility!

The rest of the camp site has really taken a beating with nearly all of the tents destroyed - a lot of people had a worse night than us it seems and quite a few are packing up and leaving early.

Whilst we really want to hike Snowdon today, we come to the conclusion that it just isn't safe, and it certainly wouldn't be any fun.
We decide to do a shorter walk along the valley to the pub instead and start to make plans to attempt Snowdon tomorrow, weather all being well.

On route, we catch a glimpse of Snowdon, or more accurately the clouds covering Snowdon, and now we know we've made the right call.

After a short but bracing 6km we arrive at the local pub for a hearty lunch. Afterwards everyone has had enough walking in the rain for the time being, and we head back to the campsite on the Snowdon Sherpa bus.

We hang out in the motor home for the rest of the afternoon playing board games and reading. We'd passed a sign on the way in advertising a Pizza truck tonight, so pre-order pizza's for dinner.

After dinner, we have an early night, hoping tonight will be quieter and wondering if we'll complete the challenge or not.
