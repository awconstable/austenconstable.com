Since it's our rest day we have a lie in before setting out on a warm up hike.

We walked the 5 minutes into Pooley Bridge and took a short steamer ride to Howtown.
It's a nice day, but it's quite breezy on the lake, and we have to wrap Einstein in a spare waterproof because he's shivering!
We walk back to Pooley Bridge reminiscing over the last time we were here when Bella was a baby, and we hiked with her in a backpack.

We stopped half-way for a packed lunch and Einy finds a dead sheep which he starts to munch on before we realise what he's doing.

We return to Pooley Bridge for a drink at the pub before we head back to the camp site for dinner and an early night.
