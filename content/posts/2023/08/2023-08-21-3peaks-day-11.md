The motor home remained safe overnight, and I get going early in order to return it at the 8am opening time.

Driving across London isn't that fun in a large vehicle, but I make it to the rental shop without issue.

I'd emailed ahead, so the rental company is expecting the damaged motor home. They seem relaxed about it, so it's probably a common occurrence!

After the inspection and some research I leave Â£762 lighter and thankful I bought the extra insurance!

We drove 1330 miles, climbed 2 of the highest 3 peaks in the UK and really had an amazing holiday. 

We're also looking forward to completing some unfinished business in Wales!
