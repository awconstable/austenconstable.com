We have an early breakfast with Grandma Anne and leave for the Lake District around 9am. 

An uneventful drive to the Lakes, and we arrive at Waterfoot Park for 2 nights and our rest day!

We set camp, figuring out how to deploy the awning and how the various hook ups work and then take a walk into Pooley Bridge
for a drink before dinner, followed by dinner at a pub in the village.

When we had checked into campsite the lady behind the desk asked if I'd been to Pooley Bridge before, when I said not for a long time,
she joked that they have a new bridge since they last time I was there. Confused I just laughed along and said goodbye.
After walking to the pub, it turns out they do have a new bridge because the original collapsed in 2015 after a storm!
