After working for the whole of the summer it's time for a holiday!

My wonderful girlfriend Di and myself are off on a road trip of the west coast USA for 10 days. We're flying into Los Angeles, renting an SUV and taking in the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Death Valley, Yosemite, finally flying out of San Francisco. Can't wait!

Here's a rough outline of the route:
