So. Finally found a computer. You'd have thought that Singapore would have 1000's of Internet cafes. Guess not.

Edge of China Town

Great city. Very clean, safe and efficient. Loads of Restaurants and great places to eat. About the perfect size for a city I'd say. Not too big and impersonal like London but big enough to stay interested.

First day I took in the Botanical Gardens, Orchard Road (The main shopping area), China Town and Boat Quay. Meet up with Rich for a few beers in Harry's bar. Allegedly where Nick Leason drank before his downfall. Ended up eating in a hawker centre pretty late which was delicious.

more Boat Quay

Second day took in Little India and did some shopping when it started to rain. Was going to do the night safari at the zoo which is supposed to be good. Didn't quite fancy it in the rain though. Met with Rich and his work colleagues and went out on the town. Excellent view of the city over Singapore Slings from the Equinox club on the 70th floor of the Swiss hotel.

Today was Saratosa (Or however you spell it) which was a little disappointing. A fake island resort just outside the city. Imported sand and everything!
