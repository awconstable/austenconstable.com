Our latest family adventure is a road trip around New Zealand for 3 weeks. We're hiring a camper and off to make some family memories. We're all super excited, New Zealand looks stunning and we can't wait to explore.

We'll be flying into Auckland via LA, spending 3 weeks touring and then flying out of Christchurch back to to the UK via Auckland and LA.

Our intended route below sees us arriving in Auckland, touring the North Island and crossing to the South Island early on Christmas Day morning.

Just 1 week to go. We'll be blogging along the way so follow along the adventure.
