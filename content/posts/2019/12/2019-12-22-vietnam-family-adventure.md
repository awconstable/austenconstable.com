We’re off on a family adventure to Vietnam. We fly into Hanoi, work our way down the country and fly out of Ho Chi Minh City 14 days later. Along the way we sleep on a junk in Halong Bay, take a sleeper train, visit Hoi An, stay overnight with a family in the Mekong Delta and experience Vietnamese sights and culture. The whole family is super excited!
